# Foundation Roadmap — Progress Tracker

Tracks execution of the three foundation plans for the parser-accuracy roadmap (issues #80, #82, #76). Order per `docs/accuracy/README.md`: B1 → B3 → A4 → D1 (D1 is a separate later plan).

**Update protocol:** check the box (`- [x]`) when a task is **merged into the working branch and reviewed (spec + code quality)**. Update the **Status** column of the batch table when every task in that batch is checked. Append a one-line entry to the **Activity Log** at the bottom for each batch transition or notable decision.

## Status Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ⬜ | Not started |
| 🟡 | In progress (at least one task started, batch not complete) |
| 🟢 | Complete and merged |
| 🔴 | Blocked — see Activity Log for the reason |
| ⏭️ | Skipped or deferred — see Activity Log |

## Cross-Plan Notes

- **B1 ships first** because B3's enclosing-function detection benefits from spans (not strictly required, but it's how the test fixtures get easier to write).
- **B3 ships before A4** because stable IDs make the parity test's same-call-different-line assertions meaningful in the future.
- **D1 (benchmark corpus) is the next plan after these three.** Track separately when written.

## Activity Log

> Append `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — <one-line update>`. Newest at top.

- 2026-05-12 03:50 — B1 **code complete**. T10 (`69ca79d`) extended `openFile` IPC with `span?` field; `webview-provider.ts` handler builds `vscode.Range` from span when present (falls back to line cursor); `ResultsPage.tsx` sends `site?.span`; webview-side `SourceSpan` mirror added to `webview/src/types.ts` for typecheck. T11 (`371fd8e`) updated `docs/accuracy/traceability.md` § B1 — 3/4 acceptance criteria automated-verified (span field present, multi-line endLine>startLine, line back-compat). **Criterion #3 (full-call selection on click) requires manual EDH verification** — F5 the dev host, run a scan on a workspace with a multi-line `await openai.chat.completions.create({...})`, click that endpoint, confirm the selection covers from `await` through the closing `)`.
- 2026-05-12 03:25 — B1 batch B complete: `ApiCallNode` gains required-nullable `span: SourceSpan | null` and `intelligence/builder.ts` populates it via `call.span ?? null` (T8, `9003f4d`); `scan-results.ts` propagates `span: call.span` at all 3 callSites construction sites (T9, `afc8f1b`). Both worktree-isolated dispatches landed directly on the working branch (same as Batch A); files disjoint, declared order preserved (T8 → T9).
- 2026-05-12 03:15 — B1 batch F4 complete: `core-scanner.ts` now threads `span` through both scan paths (T7, `282f1b8`). AST path forwards `match.span` from `AstCallMatch`; regex path computes a line-wide span (col 0 → `line.length`) — true call-tight regex spans require a `matchLine` API change that's out of scope per plan.
- 2026-05-12 03:10 — B1 batch F3 complete: `AstCallMatch.span` now required and populated at all 10 emit sites in `ast-scanner.ts` (T4, `c346867`). Five test fixtures fixed up to satisfy the new required field: `python-waste-detector.test.ts` (`901e5ae`) and `ast-{batch,cache,concurrency,cross-file-resolver}-detector.test.ts` (`6cbc4a7`, which also added pre-existing missing `confidence: 1` to the four detector helpers). All five test files now build clean and pass. Span-related tsc is fully clean.
- 2026-05-12 02:50 — B1 batch A complete: span field threaded through `CallInfo` (T3, merge of `worktree-agent-adbafd374ffba4dac`), regex match types (T5, `1db3d79`), and `ApiCallInput`/`EndpointCallSite` (T6, `94fc288`). T5 and T6 committed directly onto the working branch instead of in isolated worktrees — files are disjoint so order is preserved. Reviewer scope reduced to per-task tsc + targeted test runs.
- 2026-05-12 02:50 — **Baseline state note:** `origin/main` has 38 pre-existing tsc errors (`compression.test.ts`, `export.test.ts`, `ast-{batch,cache,concurrency,cross-file-resolver}.test.ts`, `recost-mock-calls.ts` missing SDK types, `webview-provider.ts` Promise<CompressedCluster[]> mismatch). These predate the foundation plans and are fixed by the unmerged `audit-fixes-2026-05-11` branch (notably commit `329720d fix(callers): await compressClusters …`). Because `npm test` short-circuits at tsc, the plan's "full suite green between merges" gate is replaced with per-task targeted verification until those fixes land in main. Zero new tsc errors introduced by this batch.
- 2026-05-12 02:35 — B1 batch F2 complete: SourceSpan helper tests landed (`881b918`, 3/3 cases pass). Spec + code-quality review passed with zero issues.
- 2026-05-12 02:30 — B1 batch F1 complete: SourceSpan type + helpers landed on `foundation-parser-accuracy` (commits `bdfe45d`, `7e3187f`). Spec + code-quality review passed; reviewer's Important note on exclusive-end semantics addressed inline.
- 2026-05-12 — Plans drafted, parallel batches and safety rules baked in, progress tracker initialized.
