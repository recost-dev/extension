# build-vsix.sh — Build and package the ECO extension as a .vsix file
#
# Usage (run in a bash terminal):
#   bash extension/scripts/build-vsix.sh
#
# Confirmed compatible with: Windows (Git Bash / WSL), Linux.
# Do NOT run in PowerShell or CMD — bash is required.
#
# Run from anywhere — the script resolves its own location.
# Output: eco-api-analyzer-*.vsix in the extension/ directory.
